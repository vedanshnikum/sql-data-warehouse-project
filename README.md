## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.

## Project issues - Following Data with Baraa who uses SQLServer while I use MySQL

-- Cannot do stored procedure with LOAD DATA inside  
-- MySQL does not support PRINT statements, only SELECT, which behaves differently  
-- TRY CATCH in MySQL does not work like in SQL Server  
-- DATETIME2 in SQL Server must be converted to DATETIME in MySQL  
-- ALTER TABLE / CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE syntax differs in MySQL  
-- ROW_NUMBER() and window functions require MySQL 8+, may fail in older versions  
-- Converting integer dates (YYYYMMDD) to DATE type requires extra casting  
-- Messages in SQL Server (PRINT) must be converted to SELECT or comments in MySQL  
-- Windows line endings (\r\n) need to be handled explicitly in LOAD DATA  
-- Bronze and Silver layers have different logging approaches due to MySQL limitations  
-- LEAD() function with INTERVAL subtraction may cause syntax issues in MySQL  
-- Trimming and normalizing data differs between SQL Server and MySQL  
-- Issues with gender normalization, sometimes all values return 'n/a'  
-- Differences in handling NULL and empty string values (NULLIF, IFNULL)  
-- MySQL stored procedures cannot contain multiple statements with LOAD DATA unless DELIMITER is changed
